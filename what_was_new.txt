v12.5.0
- Improved compatibility with pendrives without partition table - some pendrives would not work simply because of the way they were formatted.
Note: they still must be FAT32.

v12.4.0
- Fixed a bug where moving one player joystick and pressing buttons from the other player would send buttons pressed for both players.
- Improvements to "safe reboot/poweroff" to deal with fbneo emulator.

v12.3.0
- "Safe reboot" and "Safe shutdown" key combos are disabled if the CHA is in USB Joystick Mode.
- Fully compatible with older firmwares, no need to reinstall after upgrading firmware to v1.7
- If CHA OS is about to be updated all Choko scripts are skipped and a special script is set to run next boot (to restore files overwritten by 1.7 update).
- Fixed minor bug where default MENUCOUNTDOWN would be set to zero when going into settings.
- Updated uninstaller script.
- If SSH server from cha-1.7.img is running at boot, it is deactivated, use Choko Menu to activate server when needed.
- Updated SSH server script to use server from cha-1.7.img, if present.
- Check if SSH or FTP servers are already running before starting new server.

v12.3.0 (pre release)
- Improvements to official USB Joystick Mode in v1.7 firmware:
  Avoid the need of HDMI cable to be connected for USB Joystick mode by reading Coin1+Coin2 combo at boot.
  Also added an option to make USB Joystick Mode persistent, instead of resetting every reboot.
  Note: in USB Joystick Mode there is no need of using the CHA's power cable, it works connected only through EXT port.
- User settings (Start1+Start2 at boot: countdown, wanted resolution, USB Joystick Mode persistence) are preserved after update.

v12.2.0
- Added an option to use "sun8i-h3-orangepi-pc.dtb" from 1.6 to allow Choko Hack to load items from USB and restore "sun8i-h3-orangepi-pc.dtb" from 1.7 to use the USB Joystick Mode.

v12.1.0
- User can set a menu default option by selecting and pressing [P1 START] and reset selection pressing [P1 Insert].
- Selected option now has a different color from the other options.

v12.0.0
- Menu can now be navigated with player 1 joystick (UP and DOWN move 1 line, LEFT and RIGHT move 5 lines).
- Pressing both players Start button at startup will allow to change the timeout for USB and for menu default selection (zero disables automatic selection in menu) and optionally force screen resolution to 720p.
- File structure from version 11 is still valid, but now ROMs folders can have any name (that name will be used for the menu list).
- We are now not limited to one item per button but to screen number of rows; all available options are listed at once (USB and internal).
- New exit code 202 to allow scripts returning to menu without rebooting the CHA.
- Use 'readjoysticks' to read input, instead of relying in 'evtest' (lighter and faster; source code included).
- Extras folder: 'SSH and FTP servers' (un)installer and also a 'Choko Hack Uninstaller' (why? I don't really know...)

v11.0.1
- Force a write cache flush before reboot/shutdown, trying to avoid SD cards not updating.

v11.0.0
- New safe reboot feature (press P1-S + P1-D + P2-S + P2-D and hold).
- Support to Load multiple Hacks from USB in multiple folders with any name.
- Changed menu colors to improve readability.
- Fixed the command that could flood boot screen with error messages.
- Choko Hack version is displayed with menu.
- Although older packs may still work, they probably need to keep folder name as CHA_MOD).

v10.0.0
- New menu layout with Choko image.
- Support for multiple lists (one to each button).
- Menu option to copy games lists to internal memory of CHA (or delete them).
- New safe poweroff feature (press P1-I + P1-D + P2-I + P2-D and hold).
- No more dependency of 'dialog' external app.

Notes and technical remarks:
- 'S20usbcheck' script is now minimal: looks for 'usb_exec.sh' in '/.choko' and load; if not look in 'USB:/CHA_MOD' and load; if not, give up.
- v10 will load "old" USB:/CHA_MOD/usb_exec.sh but the new version of usb_exec.sh will refuse to run in older versions of Choko Hack.
- The same 'usb_exec.sh' can be run either from USB or internal memory.
- The Choko graphic in menu supports 720p and 1080p. Other resolutions will disrupt the image but text menu/options should still be OK and usable.
- A new script 'S11chokopoweroff' runs in background to safely unmount USB and power off (or reboot) the CHA.
  > 'usb_exec.sh' can use exit code 200 to request for safe reboot or exit code 201 to request for safe power off.

- Games lists assigned to a button have the following structure:
  > Files and folders must be named 'games1A' (for Player 1 button A), ..., 'games2F' (for Player 2 button F) and placed inside CHA_MOD (that is in the root of pendrive).
    * 'games??.nfo' have the one line title for the list (to show in menu).
    * 'games??.txt' are the list of games to replace original 'games.txt' (they must follow the structure of original file).
    * 'games??.sh' are the scripts that will effectively mount the required files in substitution of the originals.
    * 'games??' folders have the assets for the games (images, music, buttons layout, etc).
    * the ROMs must go under a folder in 'usr/share/roms/games??'
  > Each list of games can load a different core, placed in usr/lib/libretro and mounted by the 'games??.sh' script. If not using the default fbneo_libretro.so, edit the script accordingly.

- Since each list has an executable 'games??.sh' script, with little modifications it can be used to load a sub menu.

- P1 Insert: Reserved to "Capcom Official List"
- P1 Start:  Reserved to "Load from USB" or "Install Games in CHA"
- P2 Insert or P2 Start: used by Lakka installer
> If you have Lakka installed when updating Choko Hack, you'll need to run "Lakka installer and updater v4.0" after the update of the hack.
