# Choko-Hack v11.0.1
### Choko Hack for the Capcom Home Arcade

The Choko Hack will allow you to add your roms to the CHA original system. You can preserve the original software without altering and use an USB disk to play your roms.

Read the file '00 - Instructions.txt' to learn how to install.

You can also look into 'Video Guide.gif' - it's one little step outdated but still gives a good idea of the process.

### Types of Mods

We have now 3 modifications that are independent and can be combined as we wish:

A) Expand internal "disk" partition and add games to the original menu.

B) Use an USB drive to expand "disk" space and add games to the original menu.

C) Use a different operating system (Lakka), with RetroArch as user interface, with all the advantages and disadvantages it may have.

We can use one of this modifications, we can combine 2 or we can use them all.

Examples:
- Use only B and leave CHA running the original system by default, with 16 games. But when in the mood to play "X-Men vs Street Fighter", put the usb disk and add it to the list.
- Use A and B combined; put 85 Capcom games inside the CHA but when in the mood for some "Metal Slug", just insert the usb disk with Neo Geo games and enjoy.
- Use the three, A and B and C; fill the internal "disk" with Capcom games, use the usb disk with more games because internal "disk" is already full and install RetroArch to play those vertical games or other that the original system won't run.


### International model vs German model (aka with SD Card reader)

The Capcom Home Arcade has two different physical versions: with SD card reader and without.
Around 2000 units sold in Germany contains a SD Card Reader. If you have this SD Card reader, you can make the CHA boot from your SD card, the same way we can boot a PC from an USB disk or a DVD.

You can add a SD Card reader to any CHA that doesn't have it with some soldering skills and following this guide: https://cha-choko-mod.fandom.com/wiki/SD_Card_reader_MOD
