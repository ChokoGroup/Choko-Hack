v11.0.1
- Force a write cache flush before reboot/shutdown, trying to avoid SD cards not updating.

v11.0.0
- New safe reboot feature (press P1-S + P1-D + P2-S + P2-D and hold).
- Support to Load multiple Hacks from USB in multiple folders with any name.
- Changed menu colors to improve readability.
- Fixed the command that could flood boot screen with error messages.
- Choko Hack version is displayed with menu.
- Although older packs may still work, they probably need to keep folder name as CHA_MOD).

v10.0.0
- New menu layout with Choko image.
- Support for multiple lists (one to each button).
- Menu option to copy games lists to internal memory of CHA (or delete them).
- New safe poweroff feature (press P1-I + P1-D + P2-I + P2-D and hold).
- No more dependency of 'dialog' external app.

Notes and technical remarks:
- 'S20usbcheck' script is now minimal: looks for 'usb_exec.sh' in '/.choko' and load; if not look in 'USB:/CHA_MOD' and load; if not, give up.
- v10 will load "old" USB:/CHA_MOD/usb_exec.sh but the new version of usb_exec.sh will refuse to run in older versions of Choko Hack.
- The same 'usb_exec.sh' can be run either from USB or internal memory.
- The Choko graphic in menu supports 720p and 1080p. Other resolutions will disrupt the image but text menu/options should still be OK and usable.
- A new script 'S11chokopoweroff' runs in background to safely unmount USB and power off (or reboot) the CHA.
  > 'usb_exec.sh' can use exit code 200 to request for safe reboot or exit code 201 to request for safe power off.

- Games lists assigned to a button have the following structure:
  > Files and folders must be named 'games1A' (for Player 1 button A), ..., 'games2F' (for Player 2 button F) and placed inside CHA_MOD (that is in the root of pendrive).
    * 'games??.nfo' have the one line title for the list (to show in menu).
    * 'games??.txt' are the list of games to replace original 'games.txt' (they must follow the structure of original file).
    * 'games??.sh' are the scripts that will effectively mount the required files in substitution of the originals.
    * 'games??' folders have the assets for the games (images, music, buttons layout, etc).
    * the ROMs must go under a folder in 'usr/share/roms/games??'
  > Each list of games can load a different core, placed in usr/lib/libretro and mounted by the 'games??.sh' script. If not using the default fbneo_libretro.so, edit the script accordingly.

- Since each list has an executable 'games??.sh' script, with little modifications it can be used to load a sub menu.

- P1 Insert: Reserved to "Capcom Official List"
- P1 Start:  Reserved to "Load from USB" or "Install Games in CHA"
- P2 Insert or P2 Start: used by Lakka installer
> If you have Lakka installed when updating Choko Hack, you'll need to run "Lakka installer and updater v4.0" after the update of the hack.
